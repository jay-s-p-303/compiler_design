# Compiler Design Programs

|---|---|
|01|[Demonstrate a lexical analyzer for given language. Although the syntax specification states that identifiers can be arbitrarily long, you may restrict the length to some reasonable value. Simulate the same in C language.](./01/.md)|
|02|[Demonstrate a C program to identify whether a given line is a comment or not.](./02/.md)|
|03|[Demonstrate a C program to test whether a given identifier is valid or not.](./03/.md)|
|04|[Demonstrate a C program to simulate lexical analyzer for validating operators.](./04/.md)|
|05|[Demonstrate a Lexer to take input from text file and count no of characters, no. of lines & no. of words.](./05/.md)|
|06|[Demonstrate a Lex program to count number of vowels and consonants in a given input string.](./06/.md)|
|07|[Demonstrate a Lex program to count the number of comment lines in a given C program. Also eliminate them and copy that program into separate file.](./07/.md)|
|08|[Demonstrate a Lex program to print out all numbers from the given file.](./08/.md)|
|09|[Demonstrate a Lex program to printout all HTML tags in file.](./09/.md)|
|10|[Demonstrate a program to check whether Left factoring is possible on given statement.](./10/.md)|
|11|[Demonstrate a C program to implement operator precedence parsing.](./11/.md)|
|12|[Demonstrate a C program for constructing recursive descent parsing.](./12/.md)|
